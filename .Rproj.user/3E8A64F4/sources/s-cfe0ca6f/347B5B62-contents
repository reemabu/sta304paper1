# Introduction

In recent years the public eye has been on the practices of local police departments. In particular the public has been critical of how police treat minority communities. It has been documented that there are higher crime rates in minority communities than majority white communities in cities all over North America (2). Additionally, disparities in the treatment of minority communities have also been cited throughout the justice system, not just in policing (). After the death of George Floyd in 2020, there has been increased demand for the implantation of public policy to demilitarize the police, decrease funding for the police and reallocate the funds to other community and social services ().

Data from the Toronto Police Service Annual Statistics Report (ASR), which provides a comprehensive overview of police related statistics including reported crimes, was used for this report (3). The data was analyzed by a divisional basis, i.e. geographical location. Additionally, I analyzed the amount of charged that were cleared, For a charge to be “cleared” it means that “An offense can be considered cleared when a charge is laid, recommended or the person(s) who committed the offense has been identified and no charge has been laid for some reason” (1). It was found that minority communities had higher counts for charges, and a lower rate of charges cleared.

This provides further support for the need for public policies that support minority communities. Funds need to be reallocated to be redistributed to social services that can act as a preventative measure, instead of further arming the police to respond to the crime in minority communities.

The reminder of the paper: the data section, discussing the data used for this report.


You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. For instance, Section \@ref(data). R Markdown automatically makes the sections lower case and adds a dash to spaces to generate labels, for instance, Section \@ref(first-discussion-point). 

# Data

The data in the ASR has been agguraged and reported by the Toronto Police Service. The ASR is publicly available and can be accessed through the City of Toronto Open Data Portal. According to the Toronto Open portal “this data includes all crimes reported to the Toronto Police Service, including, but not limited to, those that may have been deemed unfounded after investigation, those that may have occurred outside the City of Toronto limits, or those that have no verified location(3).” The ASR contains data about the number of charges laid, how many of those charges were cleared, what category and subtype of crime was committed and which division the particular charges were reported.

The database used for this report was obtained in csv format from the City of Toronto Open Data Portal using the R package opendatatoronto (Gelfand 2020). The data is of all reported offenses from 2014-2020 and has been aggregated by year, category, subtype and geographic division. The data includes 2369 observations and 10 variables; id, index, Reported Year, GeoDivision, Category, Subtype, Count, CountCleared, ObjectId and geometry. The dataset was processed and analyzed in R (R Core Team 2020). The additional packages used are tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019) and dplyr (Wickham et al. 2021) packages. Graphs and tables were created with ggplot (Wickham 2016) and knitr (Xie 2021a). A sample view of the data can be seen below.

```{r echo = FALSE}
tibble(data)
```

For my analysis I decided to sample just the data from the calendar year 2020. Additionally, some of the observations had not specified, “NSA,” reported as their GeoDivision so I filtered those observations out of the data set. The variables of interest were kept in the data set while; id, index_,ObjectId and geometry were filtered out. This left us with 318 observations and 6 variables. The Count_ variable is the number of cases for a specific category, subcategory and division and is a numerical variable. The CountCleared is the number of cases that were cleared from the Count_  variable and is also a numerical variable. The GeoDivision variable is a categorical variable specifying the police division the charge was reported. The category variable is a categorical variable specifying the categories of crime reported. There are 5 categories, “Crimes Against Property," “Crimes Against the Person,” Controlled Drugs and Substances Act," "Criminal Code Traffic," “Other Criminal Code Violations," and "Other Federal Statute Violations." Subtype is also a categorical variable specifying the sub-category of crime reported.

Table 1 shows an alternative view of the data broken down by division. It can be seen that regardless of division, crimes against properties are the most common and federal violations are the least common. It should also be noted that the ASR reports which division the crime was committed, not where the person charged with the crime lives. This is particularly useful to keep in mind for the criminal code traffic violations. Division 32 (D32) has the highest number of crimes reported and Division 12 (D12) has the lowest number of crimes reported.

**Graph 1: Rates of Charges Cleared by Division**

Graph 1 plots the divisions against their computed clearance rates, i.e. the percentage of the charges cleared. The rate cleared variable was computed using the Count and CountCleared variables in the dataset.

There are some biases and ethical concerns to consider with this dataset. Firstly, not all crime is reported to the police, about two-thirds of Canadians stated that they did not report to the police when they were a victim of a crime (). Therefore the ASR is not entirely reflective of the amount of crime occuring in the city. Additionally, there is a substantial risk of bias as the police department is providing data about itself, as opposed to an external independent and impartial department doing the data collection and reporting. Finally, a substantial part of the year 2020 was spent in lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic and it is so far unclear how this factor has played a role in the amount of crime in the city. 


Our data is of penguins (Figure \@ref(fig:bills)).

```{r setup, echo = FALSE}
```

Talk more about it.

Also bills and their average (Figure \@ref(fig:billssssss)). (Notice how you can change the height and width so they don't take the whole page?)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
```

Talk way more about it.
